# Manual: Generating a Vehicle Quote with Optional Packs

## Steps

### 1. Creating a New Quote  
1. Access the quote module of the system.  
2. Create a new **"Dealer Quote"**.  
3. Assign the vehicle series and the customer for whom the quote is being generated.  

### 2. Selecting the Vehicle and Options  
1. Click the **"Add Vehicle/Product"** button.  
2. In the pop-up window, select the vehicle for which you want to generate the quote.  
3. The system will display a list of available options for the selected vehicle.  
4. For each option, you can:  
   - Modify the desired quantity.  
   - Delete it if you don't want to include it in the quote.  

### 3. Visualizing and Configuring the Quote  
1. Once the options are selected, click the **"Accept"** button.  
2. The system will add the vehicle and the options to the quote.  
3. The quote will be displayed in two formats:  
   - **Detailed Format**: Shows each option line with its individual price, the selected quantity, and the discount applied (if any).  
   - **Summary Format**: Shows the total price of each option, including the discount applied (if any), in a single line.  
4. You can select the visualization format of the quote in the system settings.  

### 4. Saving the Quote  
1. Review the final quote to ensure the information is correct.  
2. Click the **"Save"** button to save the quote.  

### 5. Sending the Quote to the Customer  
1. Once the quote is saved, you can:  
   - Send it to the customer by email.  
   - Print it in physical format.

## Additional Considerations  
- The system automatically applies the discounts configured in the option sheets when generating the quote.  
- You can modify the prices and discounts of the options directly in the quote before saving it.  
- It is possible to generate quotes for multiple vehicles at once.  

## Additional Resources  
- Refer to the section **[Creating a New Vehicle with Optional Packs](http://localhost:4321/primerpresupuesto/pagina7/)** for more information on configuring optional packs.  
- Review the system documentation for detailed information on quote management.
