# The Agenda in eV4 CRM

The **Agenda** in eV4 CRM is a key tool for organizing and tracking activities related to leads, opportunities, and quotes. This feature allows users to schedule appointments, tasks, and reminders efficiently, as well as clearly visualize opportunities in different stages, thanks to color assignment. The use of colors is a critical feature that aids visual organization, highlighting various statuses and stages of opportunities and tasks, which improves productivity and activity control.

This tutorial will guide you through using the agenda, managing opportunities and tasks from the CRM, and utilizing colors to enhance the clarity of daily operations.

## Step 1: Accessing the Agenda in eV4 CRM

### Access the Agenda:
- From the main menu of eV4, select the CRM module and navigate to the Agenda option.
- Here, you will see a calendar or timeline showing all appointments and events related to opportunities, clients, and other assigned tasks.

### Agenda View:
You can switch between different views:
- **Daily View:** Displays activities for a specific day.
- **Weekly View:** Allows you to see all activities for the week.
- **Monthly View:** A broader view of all tasks and scheduled appointments for the month.

In any of these views, activities are displayed in an organized manner, with the ability to interact with each of them.

## Step 2: Adding and Managing Events in the Agenda

### Create a New Appointment or Event:
To add a new appointment or event:
1. Select a space in the agenda and click **Add new appointment**.
2. Enter the relevant event information, including:
   - **Date and Time:** The start and end time of the event.
   - **Client or Lead:** Select the associated client, lead, or opportunity.
   - **Description:** Add details about the appointment, such as the purpose or the opportunity phase.
   - **Reminders:** You can set reminders to receive notifications before the event.

### Managing Opportunities and Leads from the Agenda:
- In addition to events, the agenda can synchronize opportunities and leads, making follow-up easier.
- Every time you create a quote or lead, these can automatically appear in the agenda as an associated event, reminding you when follow-up actions are needed.

### Modify or Delete Appointments:
- To modify an existing appointment, simply click on the event in the agenda and select **Edit**.
- If no longer needed, you can delete the appointment directly from the same interface.

## Step 3: Using Colors in the Agenda

One of the most powerful features of eV4â€™s agenda is the color management, which allows you to visually distinguish between different types of events, opportunity statuses, or sales process stages.

### Assigning Colors Based on Opportunity Status:
- Opportunities can be assigned to different stages (such as new, in negotiation, closed-won, etc.), and each stage can have an associated color.
- This allows you to easily identify the current status of each opportunity directly from the agenda.

**Example of colors:**
- ðŸŸ¢ Green: Won opportunity or accepted quote.
- ðŸ”´ Red: Canceled or lost opportunity.
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Opportunity in negotiation or pending response.

### Colors for Rental Status:
For companies that manage rentals, colors play a key role in quickly identifying the status of rental contracts. These can include:
- âšª **Cancelled:** Gray color.
- ðŸ”µ **In Progress:** Blue color.
- ðŸŸ  **Pending:** Orange color.
- ðŸŸ¢ **Reserved:** Light green color.

These colors provide clear control over the rental workflow and status.

### Colors for Appointment Types:
- When creating a new appointment, you can assign a specific color depending on the task type (meeting with client, opportunity follow-up, etc.).
- This helps the sales team stay organized by distinguishing between different types of appointments or tasks in the agenda.

### Colors for Teams or Employees:
- It is also possible to assign colors to different employees or teams within the CRM. This allows each user to easily view and manage their appointments and distinguish tasks based on the assigned responsible party.
- This is useful for managing shared agendas, enabling teams to clearly see who is in charge of each task or opportunity.

## Step 4: Synchronizing and Tracking Opportunities from the Agenda

### Automatic Synchronization:
- Each generated opportunity, whether through a quote or lead, can automatically synchronize with the agenda.
- This ensures that any new opportunity is visible to the sales manager, with automatic reminders scheduled for follow-up.

### Opportunity Tracking:
- The agenda allows you to continuously track each opportunity, reminding you of the next event or action to take.
- Additionally, you can view the activity history related to each opportunity, helping you maintain a clear and up-to-date record.

### Opportunity Timeline View:
- The agenda offers a **timeline** view, where you can see the status and events related to each opportunity or client.
- This helps manage time and ensures no appointments or tasks are missed.

## Step 5: Advanced Agenda Configuration

### Set Reminders and Alerts:
- You can set automatic reminders that will be sent before important appointments or events.
- This ensures that the sales team never misses an opportunity for contact or follow-up.

### Personalizing the Agenda:
- Users can customize the agenda display by changing colors, statuses, and stages according to the specific needs of the business.
- This can be done from the CRMâ€™s configuration panel, allowing you to adjust the agenda to fit your teamâ€™s workflow methodology.

## Conclusion
The agenda in **eV4 CRM** is a powerful tool for planning and tracking commercial tasks and opportunities. The use of colors improves visual clarity, allowing you to quickly identify the status of each ongoing opportunity or task. By leveraging synchronization, reminders, and agenda customization features, sales teams can manage their activities more efficiently, ensuring each opportunity is handled optimally from the first contact to closing.
