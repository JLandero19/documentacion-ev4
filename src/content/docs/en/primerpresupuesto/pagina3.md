## **Step 1: Creating a Quote in the CRM**

### **Accessing the CRM Module**
1. From the **eV4** main menu, go to the **CRM** module.
2. Select the **Leads** or **Opportunities** option, depending on whether you are working with a new or existing contact.

### **Starting a Quote**
1. Inside the **lead** or **opportunity** record, look for the **Quotes** tab or section.
2. Click on **"New Quote"** to start creating the quote.

### **Completing the Quote Information**
- **Client:** Ensure that the lead or contact is properly assigned as a client.  
- **Products or Services:** Add the products or services that will be part of the quote. You can select items from the available product catalog.  
- **Prices and Quantities:** Define the price for each product or service, along with the quantities requested.  
- **Quote Date:** Specify the date the quote is generated.  
- **Comments:** Add any relevant notes about the quote or special conditions.  

### **Automatic Opportunity Generation**
- When creating the quote, the system can be configured to **automatically create a follow-up opportunity**.  
- This feature ensures that the sales team has a record and can manage the quote in an organized way until it closes as a sale.

## **Step 2: Tracking Quotes**
Tracking quotes is crucial to maintaining visibility of each opportunity’s status. The **eV4 CRM** simplifies this process by updating phases and managing events.

### **Opportunity Phase**
Each quote is linked to an opportunity that passes through various phases, such as:
- **New:** The quote has been created but has not yet been presented to the client.
- **In Negotiation:** The quote has been sent to the client, and details are being discussed.
- **Closed - Won:** The quote has been accepted, and the opportunity has turned into a sale.
- **Closed - Lost:** The quote has been rejected, or the opportunity did not materialize.

### **Events and Next Actions**
- Assign a next event to the quote so that the sales team remembers to follow up (**calls, meetings, quote reviews, etc.**).
- You can configure **automatic reminders** to ensure no quote goes without follow-up.

### **Probability and Opportunity Value**
- It’s important to update the **probability of success** and the **estimated opportunity value**.  
- This will help the team prioritize opportunities with the highest chance of turning into sales.

## **Step 3: Confirming or Cancelling Quotes**
Once the client has reviewed the quote, adjustments may be made, or it may need to be confirmed or canceled.

### **Confirming a Quote**
1. If the client **accepts the quote**, mark the quote as **"Confirmed"** in the system.
2. This will automatically change the opportunity phase to **"Closed - Won"**, indicating that the sale has been finalized.
3. If the quote is associated with a vehicle at a dealership, the system will automatically mark the vehicle as **"Sold"**, updating the inventory deactivation date upon confirmation.

### **Canceling a Quote**
1. If the client **rejects the quote**, you can mark it as **"Cancelled"**.
2. This will update the opportunity phase to **"Closed - Lost"**.
3. You can configure the system to have **canceled opportunities hide**, keeping the panel clean and focused on active opportunities.

## **Step 4: Viewing and Managing Opportunities in the Agenda**
### **View Opportunities in the Agenda**
- Configure the system to have **active opportunities** displayed in the **CRM agenda**.  
- This way, the sales team can view their upcoming events and appointments related to the quotes in an organized manner.

### **Visible States in the Agenda**
- You can configure different **opportunity states** to be reflected in the **agenda timeline**.  
- For example, for **rental businesses**, states such as **"In Progress"**, **"Reserved"**, or **"Cancelled"** can be displayed directly in the agenda view, improving workflow control.

---

## **Step 5: Auto-Opportunity Setup from Quotes**
### **Save Quote Data in the "Name" Field**
- Configure the CRM to automatically save the **quote name** in the **"Opportunity Name"** field.
- This makes it easier to identify opportunities, especially when managing multiple quotes per lead.

### **Use a Shortened Item Name**
- If you work with long items or extensive descriptions, you can configure the system to use the **shortened item name** instead of the full name in the **"Opportunity Name"** field.
- This helps make opportunity management **clearer and more organized**.

---

## **Conclusion**
The generation and tracking of quotes in the **eV4 CRM** is a simple yet powerful process for **maximizing sales opportunities**.  

By generating quotes and automatically linking them to opportunities, you can manage the sales cycle from **the first contact to the final sale**.  

Proper configuration and use of tools such as the **agenda and opportunity phases** ensures an **efficient workflow** for the sales team.
