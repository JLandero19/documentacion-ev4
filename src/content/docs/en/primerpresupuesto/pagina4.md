# Module: CRM (Leads)

The **eV4 CRM module** allows for efficient management of **leads (business opportunities)**, whether generated automatically from **web forms** or created manually as **opportunities**.

A lead generated through the web includes data such as **name, email, phone, and comments**. If the lead is related to a **product or vehicle**, an automatic **linked opportunity** is created for the sales representative to manage.

This tutorial explains how to manage **leads in both simple and advanced formats**, how to **convert a lead into a customer by accepting a quote**, and how to manage the **sale of a vehicle in dealerships**.

---

## **Step 1: Lead Generation and Management**

### **Leads Generated from Web Forms**
When a potential customer fills out a form on the website, the system automatically generates a contact with the customer's details, such as:
- **Name**
- **Email**
- **Phone**
- **Comments**

If the inquiry is related to a **vehicle or product**, an automatic **linked opportunity** is created for that product, which the sales representative will need to manage.

### **Manual Lead Creation**
Users can **create leads manually** from the **CRM module**, entering the potential customer's information and associating the opportunity with a sales representative.

## **Step 2: Viewing Lead Information (Simple and Advanced Format)**

### **Lead in Simple Format**
In **simple format**, key fields for quickly managing a lead are displayed:

- **Client:** Name of the client or company.
- **Services:** Product or service of interest.
- **Opportunity Phase:** Current status of the opportunity (*First contact, Negotiation, Closed*).
- **Next Event Date:** Scheduled date for the next contact.
- **Probability:** Estimated success percentage.
- **Amount:** Estimated value of the sale.
- **Project:** Project or area related to the lead.
- **Source:** Origin of the lead (*Web, Call, Event*).
- **Notes:** Additional information relevant to the sales representative.

### **Lead in Advanced Format**
The **advanced format** provides more detailed functionalities, including multiple tabs to manage the quote and budget flow.

#### **Contact Information**
- **Contact Date and Time**
- **Legal Form:** Indicates whether it is a company or an individual.
- **Commercial Name**
- **Corporate Name**
- **Phone**
- **Email**
- **Contact Source:** The origin from which the lead was generated.
- **Address, Postal Code, Country, Province, City**
- **Bank Account (IBAN, Entity, Office, etc.)**

#### **Generating Opportunities and Quotes**
- In the **lead manager**, multiple **quotes** can be created linked to the lead.
- Quotes can be **confirmed or canceled** from the same manager.
- Once accepted, the approved quote **converts the lead into a sale**.

---

## **Step 3: Converting a Lead into a Customer**

### **Accepting a Quote**
- Upon accepting a **quote**, the system automatically converts the contact into a **Customer**.  
- This means it will **no longer be managed as a lead**, but will be added to the client database with all previously gathered information.

### **Conversion Process**
- The system **updates the contact record** with the new **Customer** category.
- All relevant information, including **quotes, previous opportunities, and notes**, is retained.

---

## **Step 4: Managing Quotes in Dealerships**

### **Quote Linked to a Vehicle**
- If the lead is related to a **vehicle (in dealerships)**, when the quote is accepted, the system **automatically marks the vehicle as sold**.
- The vehicle is **deactivated in the system**, and the **deactivation date** is assigned when the sales representative marks the quote as **accepted**.

### **Automatic Inventory Control**
- The system automatically manages the **inventory** when the vehicle is deactivated.
- It **marks the vehicle as unavailable** for other clients and **updates its status** in databases, internal catalogs, and the website.

---

## **Step 5: Follow-up and Completion**

### **Opportunity Phases**
Opportunities go through different phases, from the **first contact to closing the sale**:

1. **New:** First contact.
2. **Qualified:** The lead has been evaluated and shows clear interest.
3. **Negotiation:** Terms of the sale are being discussed.
4. **Closed - Won:** The sale has been successfully completed.
5. **Closed - Lost:** The opportunity was not realized.

### **Quote Confirmation**
- Once the **quote is accepted**, the sales process continues with the **new customer**.
- All subsequent stages, such as **product or service delivery**, are ensured.

---

## **Conclusion**
The **eV4 CRM module** allows for **comprehensive lead management**, from **generation to conversion into customers**, optimizing the sales process.  

Additionally, in **dealerships**, the system automatically **deactivates vehicles** when a quote is accepted, improving **inventory control and sales**.
