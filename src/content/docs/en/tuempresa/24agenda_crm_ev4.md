#### Module: CRM (Agenda)

The **Agenda** in the eV4 CRM is a key tool for organizing and tracking activities related to leads, opportunities, and quotes. This feature allows users to efficiently plan appointments, tasks, and reminders, as well as clearly visualize opportunities in different stages through color coding. The use of colors is an essential feature that facilitates visual organization, highlighting different states and stages of opportunities and tasks, which enhances productivity and control of commercial activities.

This tutorial will guide you through using the agenda, managing opportunities and tasks from the CRM, and using colors to improve clarity in daily management.

#### Step 1: Accessing the Agenda in eV4 CRM

##### Access the Agenda:
- From the main menu of eV4, select the **CRM** module and go to the **Agenda** option.
- Here, you will see a calendar or timeline displaying all appointments and events related to opportunities, clients, and other assigned tasks.

##### Agenda View:
You can switch between different views:
- **Daily View**: Shows activities for a specific day.
- **Weekly View**: Allows you to see all activities for the week.
- **Monthly View**: A broader view of all tasks and appointments scheduled for the month.

In any of these views, activities are displayed in an organized and clear way, with the option to interact with each one.

#### Step 2: Adding and Managing Events in the Agenda

##### Create a New Appointment or Event:
To add a new appointment or event, select a space in the agenda and click **Add New Appointment**. Enter the relevant event information, including:
- **Date and Time**: The start and end time of the event.
- **Client or Lead**: Choose the client, lead, or opportunity associated with the event.
- **Description**: Add details about the appointment, such as its purpose or the opportunity's stage.
- **Reminders**: You can set reminders to receive notifications before the event.

##### Managing Opportunities and Leads from the Agenda:
In addition to events, the agenda can synchronize opportunities and leads, making it easier to track them.
Each time you create a quote or lead, these can automatically be visualized in the agenda with an associated event, reminding you when follow-up actions are needed.

##### Modify or Delete Appointments:
To modify an existing appointment, simply click on the event in the agenda and select **Edit**.
If no longer needed, you can delete the appointment directly from the same interface.

#### Step 3: Using Colors in the Agenda

One of the most powerful features of the eV4 agenda is color management, which allows you to visually distinguish between different types of events, opportunity statuses, or sales process stages.

##### Assigning Colors by Opportunity Status:
Opportunities can be assigned to different stages (such as new, in negotiation, closed-won, etc.), and each stage can have an associated color.
This makes it easy to identify the current state of each opportunity at a glance, directly from the agenda.

Example of colors:
- **Green**: Opportunity won or quote accepted.
- **Red**: Opportunity canceled or lost.
- **Yellow**: Opportunity in negotiation or awaiting response.

##### Colors for Lease Status:
In businesses that manage rentals, colors play a key role in quickly identifying the status of rental contracts. These can include:
- **Canceled**: Gray color.
- **Ongoing**: Blue color.
- **Pending**: Orange color.
- **Reserved**: Light green color.

These colors provide a clear overview of the rental workflow and status.

##### Colors for Appointment Types:
When creating a new appointment, you can assign a specific color based on the type of task (meeting with client, opportunity follow-up, etc.). This helps the sales team stay better organized by distinguishing between different appointment types or tasks in the agenda.

##### Colors for Teams or Employees:
It is also possible to assign colors to different employees or teams within the CRM. This allows each user to easily see and manage their appointments and distinguish tasks based on the assigned responsible person.
This is useful for managing shared agendas, allowing teams to see who is in charge of each task or opportunity.

#### Step 4: Synchronizing and Tracking Opportunities from the Agenda

##### Automatic Synchronization:
Each generated opportunity, whether through a quote or lead, can be automatically synchronized with the agenda.
This ensures that any new opportunity is visible to the responsible sales representative, with automatic reminders scheduled for follow-up.

##### Opportunity Tracking:
The agenda allows you to continuously track each opportunity, reminding you of the next event or action to take.
Additionally, you can view the activity history related to each opportunity, helping to maintain a clear and up-to-date record.

##### Viewing the Opportunity Timeline:
The agenda offers a **timeline** view, where you can see the status and events related to each opportunity or client. This helps with time management and ensures that no important appointments or tasks are missed.

#### Step 5: Advanced Agenda Settings

##### Setting Reminders and Alerts:
You can set automatic reminders that will be sent before important appointments or events. This ensures that the sales team never misses an opportunity for contact or follow-up.

##### Personalizing the Agenda:
Users can customize the agenda view by changing colors, statuses, and stages based on the company's specific needs. This can be done from the CRM's configuration panel, allowing the agenda to be adjusted to your team's workflow.

#### Conclusion

The eV4 CRM agenda is a powerful tool for planning and tracking commercial tasks and opportunities. The use of colors improves visual clarity, allowing you to quickly identify the status of each opportunity or task. By utilizing the agenda's synchronization, reminder, and personalization features, sales teams can manage their activities more efficiently, ensuring that every opportunity is managed optimally from the first contact to closing.
