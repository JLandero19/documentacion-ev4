#### Module: CRM (Leads)

The eV4 CRM module allows efficient management of leads (business opportunities), whether they are automatically generated from web forms or manually created as opportunities. A lead generated through the web includes data such as name, email, phone number, and comments. If the lead is related to an article or vehicle, a linked opportunity is automatically created that the sales manager must manage.

This tutorial explains how to manage leads in both simple and advanced formats, as well as the process of converting a lead into a customer by accepting a quote, and how to manage vehicle sales in dealerships.

##### Step 1: Lead Generation and Management

- **Leads generated from web forms**:
    - When a potential customer completes a form on the website, the system automatically generates a contact with the customer's data, such as:
        - Name
        - Email
        - Phone number
        - Comments
    - If the inquiry is associated with a vehicle or item, an opportunity linked to that product is automatically created for the sales manager to handle.

- **Manual lead creation**:
    - Users can create leads manually from the CRM module by entering the potential customer's information and associating the opportunity with a sales representative.

##### Step 2: Viewing Lead Information (Simple and Advanced Format)

#### Simple Format Lead

In the simple format, the key fields for quickly managing a lead are displayed:

- **Client**: Name of the client or company.
- **Services**: Product or service of interest.
- **Opportunity Stage**: Current status of the opportunity (e.g., first contact, negotiation, closed).
- **Next Event Date**: Scheduled date for the next contact.
- **Probability**: Estimated success in percentage.
- **Amount**: Estimated value of the sale.
- **Project**: Project or area related to the lead.
- **Source**: Origin of the lead (web, call, event, etc.).
- **Notes**: Additional information relevant to the salesperson.

#### Advanced Format Lead

The advanced format offers more detailed features, including multiple tabs to manage the quoting and budgeting flow.

- **Contact Information**:
    - Date of contact
    - Time of contact
    - Legal form: Indicates whether it is a company or an individual.
    - Trade name
    - Company name
    - Phone number
    - Email
    - Source of the contact: The origin from which the lead came.
    - Address, postal code, country, province, locality: Geographical details of the client.
    - Bank account (IBAN, bank, branch, etc.).

- **Opportunity and Quote Generation**:
    - In the lead manager, multiple quotes can be created associated with the lead.
    - Quotes can be confirmed or canceled from the same manager. Once accepted, the approved quote converts the lead into a sale.

##### Step 3: Converting a Lead to a Customer

- **Quote Acceptance**:
    - By accepting a quote, the system automatically converts the contact into a customer. This means that it will no longer be managed as a lead but will become part of the customer database, with all previously collected information.

- **Conversion Process**:
    - The system updates the contact record with the new "Customer" category and retains all relevant information, including quotes, prior opportunities, and notes.

##### Step 4: Managing Quotes in Dealerships

- **Quote related to a vehicle**:
    - If the lead is related to a vehicle (in dealerships), when the quote is accepted, the system automatically marks the vehicle as sold.
    - The vehicle is deactivated in the system, and the deactivation date is set as the date when the salesperson marks the quote as accepted.

- **Automatic inventory control**:
    - The system automatically manages the inventory when the vehicle is deactivated, marking it as unavailable for other customers and updating the status in the internal databases and catalogs, as well as on the website.

##### Step 5: Follow-up and Completion

- **Opportunity Stages**:
    - Opportunities go through different stages, from the first contact to the closure of the sale:
        - New: First contact.
        - Qualified: The lead has been evaluated and shows clear interest.
        - Negotiation: The terms of the sale are being discussed.
        - Closed - Won: The sale has been successfully completed.
        - Closed - Lost: The opportunity was not completed.

- **Quote Confirmation**:
    - Once the quote is accepted, the sale process continues with the new customer, ensuring that all subsequent stages, such as product or service delivery, are managed correctly.

#### Conclusion

The eV4 CRM module allows for comprehensive lead management, from generation to conversion into customers, optimizing the sales process. Additionally, in dealerships, the system automatically deactivates vehicles when a quote is accepted, improving inventory control and sales management.
