#### Welcome to eV4ERP, we make the complex simple

Our software will allow you to manage your business more efficiently. Let's quickly explore the eV4ERP interface.

eV4ERP has two toolbars.

#### 1. TOP RIGHT BAR

In the top right corner of the screen, we have the quick access toolbar:

![Step 2](../../../../assets/tu_empresa/interfaz_2.png)

This toolbar provides eight quick access buttons to different functions that we can execute with just one click, saving time while working. These buttons are from left to right:

- **êšš**: The "+" button allows us to create a new customer, a new sales invoice, a new ticket, a new supplier, a new purchase invoice, or access reports with a single click.

![Step 3](../../../../assets/tu_empresa/interfaz_3.png)

- **SEARCH**: The magnifying glass button lets us search (for items, customers, suppliers, etc.) in the eV4ERP database.

![Step 4](../../../../assets/tu_empresa/interfaz_4.png)

When clicked, a window will open where we can enter the search terms, and the results will appear below.
