#### Module: CRM (Budgets)

The eV4 CRM module not only allows you to manage leads and opportunities, but also provides a complete tool for the creation and tracking of budgets. This process is key to converting leads into sales, as a well-managed budget can be the difference between winning or losing an opportunity. Additionally, the system facilitates the tracking of budgets at each phase of the sales cycle, ensuring efficient and organized management.

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating, managing, and tracking budgets in eV4 CRM, and how to leverage the features to improve commercial efficiency.

## Step 1: Creating a Budget in the CRM

1. **Access the CRM Module**:
   - From the main eV4 menu, go to the CRM module.
   - Select the **Leads** or **Opportunities** option, depending on whether you're working with a new contact or an existing one.

2. **Start a Budget**:
   - Once inside the lead or opportunity record, find the **Budgets** tab or section.
   - Click on **New Budget** to start the creation process.

3. **Complete the Budget Information**:
   - **Client**: Ensure that the lead or contact is correctly assigned as a client.
   - **Products or Services**: Add the products or services that will be included in the budget. You can select items from the available product catalog.
   - **Prices and Quantities**: Define the price for each product or service along with the requested quantities.
   - **Budget Date**: Specify the date when the budget is generated.
   - **Comments**: Add any observations or special conditions regarding the budget.

4. **Automatic Opportunity Generation**:
   - When the budget is generated, the system may be configured to automatically create a follow-up opportunity. This feature ensures that the sales team has a record and can manage the budget in an organized manner until it is closed as a sale.

## Step 2: Tracking Budgets

Tracking budgets is crucial to maintain visibility of the status of each opportunity. The eV4 CRM facilitates this process through phase updates and event management.

1. **Opportunity Phase**:
   - Each budget is linked to an opportunity that goes through various phases, such as:
     - **New**: The budget has been created but not yet presented to the client.
     - **In Negotiation**: The budget has been sent to the client, and the details are being discussed.
     - **Closed - Won**: The budget has been accepted, and the opportunity has been converted into a sale.
     - **Closed - Lost**: The budget has been rejected, or the opportunity did not materialize.

2. **Events and Next Actions**:
   - Assign a next event to the budget so that the sales team remembers to perform timely follow-ups (calls, meetings, budget reviews, etc.).
   - You can set up automatic reminders to avoid leaving any budget without follow-up.

3. **Opportunity Probability and Value**:
   - It's important to update the **probability of success** and the **estimated amount** for the opportunity. This will help the team prioritize opportunities with a higher likelihood of converting into sales.

## Step 3: Budget Confirmation or Cancellation

Once the client has reviewed the budget, adjustments may be made, or it may need to be confirmed or canceled.

1. **Confirm Budget**:
   - If the client accepts the budget, mark the budget as **confirmed** in the system. This will automatically change the opportunity phase to **"Closed - Won"**, indicating that the sale has been finalized.
   - If the budget is associated with a vehicle in a dealership, the system will automatically mark the vehicle as sold, updating the inventory's deactivation date upon confirmation.

2. **Cancel Budget**:
   - If the client does not accept the budget, you can mark it as **canceled**. This will update the opportunity phase to **"Closed - Lost"**.
   - Additionally, you can configure the system to hide canceled opportunities, keeping the panel clean and focused on active opportunities.

## Step 4: Viewing and Managing Opportunities in the Agenda

1. **View Opportunities in the Agenda**:
   - Configure the system so that active opportunities are reflected in the CRM agenda. This way, the sales team can see their upcoming events and appointments related to the budgets in an organized manner.

2. **Visible States in the Agenda**:
   - You can configure different opportunity states to be reflected in the agenda's timeline. For example, for rental companies, states like **In Progress**, **Reserved**, or **Canceled** can be shown directly in the agenda view, improving the workflow control.

## Step 5: Auto-Opportunities Configuration from Budgets

1. **Save Budget Data in the "Name" Field**:
   - Configure the CRM so that the name of the budget is automatically saved in the **Name** field of the opportunity. This facilitates the identification of opportunities, especially when managing multiple budgets per lead.

2. **Use Shortened Item Names**:
   - If you work with long items or extensive descriptions, you can configure the system to use the shortened item name instead of the full name in the **Name** field of the opportunity. This makes opportunity management clearer and more organized.

## Conclusion

The creation and tracking of budgets in the eV4 CRM is a straightforward but powerful process for maximizing commercial opportunities. By generating budgets and automatically linking them to opportunities, you can manage the sales cycle from the first contact to the closing of the sale. Proper configuration and use of tools like the agenda and opportunity phases ensure an efficient workflow for the sales team.
