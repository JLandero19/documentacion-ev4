title: Creating a Quote for a Vehicle with Optional Packs

---

This manual describes the process for generating a quote for a vehicle that includes optional packs.

## Steps:

### 1. Creating a New Quote

1. **Access the quotes module** in the system.
2. Create a new **"Dealership Quote"**.
3. Assign the vehicle series and the customer for whom the quote is generated.

### 2. Selecting the Vehicle and Options

1. Click on the **"Add vehicle/product"** button.
2. In the pop-up window, select the vehicle for which you want to generate the quote.
3. The system will display a list of available options for the selected vehicle.
4. For each option, you can modify the desired quantity or remove it if you don’t want to include it in the quote.

### 3. Viewing and Configuring the Quote

1. Once the options are selected, click on the **"Accept"** button.
2. The system will add the vehicle and options to the quote.
3. The quote will be displayed in two formats:
   - **Detailed format**: Shows each option line with its individual price, selected quantity, and discount applied (if applicable).
   - **Summary format**: Displays the total price of each option, including any discount applied, on a single line.
4. You can select the display format for the quote in the system settings.

### 4. Saving the Quote

1. Review the final quote to ensure the information is correct.
2. Click on the **"Save"** button to save the quote.

### 5. Sending the Quote to the Customer

1. Once the quote is saved, you can send it to the customer via email or print it in a physical format.

## Additional Considerations

- The system automatically applies any discounts configured in the option files when generating the quote.
- You can modify the prices and discounts of the options directly within the quote before saving it.
- It is possible to generate quotes for multiple vehicles at once.

## Additional Resources

- Check the **"Creating a New Vehicle with Optional Packs"** section for more information on configuring optional packs.
- Review the system documentation for detailed information on quote management.
