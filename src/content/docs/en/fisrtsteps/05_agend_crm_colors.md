---

#### Module: CRM (Agenda)

The Agenda in the eV4 CRM is a key tool for organizing and tracking activities related to leads, opportunities, and quotes. This functionality allows users to efficiently plan meetings, tasks, and reminders, as well as clearly view opportunities in different stages by assigning colors. The use of colors is an essential feature that facilitates visual organization, highlighting different states and phases of opportunities and tasks, improving productivity and commercial activity control.

This tutorial will guide you through the use of the agenda, how to manage opportunities and tasks from the CRM, and how to use colors to improve the clarity of daily management.

## Step 1: Accessing the Agenda in eV4 CRM

1. **Access the Agenda**:
   - From the main menu of eV4, select the CRM module and go to the **Agenda** option.
   - Here, you’ll see a calendar or timeline displaying all appointments and events related to opportunities, clients, and other assigned tasks.

2. **Agenda View**:
   - You can switch between different views:
     - **Daily View**: Shows the activities for a specific day.
     - **Weekly View**: Lets you see all activities for the week.
     - **Monthly View**: A broader view of all tasks and appointments scheduled for the month.
   - In any of these views, activities are displayed in an organized and clear manner, with the option to interact with each one.

## Step 2: Adding and Managing Events in the Agenda

1. **Create a New Appointment or Event**:
   - To add a new appointment or event, select a slot in the agenda and click on **Add New Appointment**.
   - Enter the relevant event information, including:
     - **Date and Time**: The start and end times of the event.
     - **Client or Lead**: Select the associated client, lead, or opportunity.
     - **Description**: Add details about the appointment, such as the purpose or the opportunity phase.
     - **Reminders**: Set up reminders to receive notifications before the event.

2. **Manage Opportunities and Leads from the Agenda**:
   - In addition to events, the agenda can sync opportunities and leads, making it easier to follow up.
   - Every time you generate a quote or lead, these can automatically be displayed in the agenda with an associated event, reminding you when follow-up actions are needed.

3. **Modify or Delete Appointments**:
   - To modify an existing appointment, simply click on the event in the agenda and select **Edit**.
   - If no longer needed, you can delete the appointment directly from the same interface.

## Step 3: Using Colors in the Agenda

One of the most powerful features of the eV4 agenda is color management, which allows you to visually distinguish between different types of events, opportunity states, or phases of the sales process.

1. **Assign Colors by Opportunity State**:
   - Opportunities can be assigned to different stages (e.g., new, in negotiation, closed-won, etc.), and each stage can have a color associated with it.
   - This makes it easy to quickly identify the current state of each opportunity directly from the agenda.
     - **Example of Colors**:
       - **Green**: Won opportunity or accepted quote.
       - **Red**: Cancelled or lost opportunity.
       - **Yellow**: Opportunity in negotiation or awaiting a response.

2. **Colors for Rental Status**:
   - In companies that manage rentals, colors play a key role in quickly identifying the status of rental contracts. These can include:
     - **Cancelled**: Gray color.
     - **In progress**: Blue color.
     - **Pending**: Orange color.
     - **Reserved**: Light green color.
   - These colors provide clear control over the workflow and rental status.

3. **Configure Colors for Appointment Types**:
   - When creating a new appointment, you can assign a specific color depending on the task type (client meeting, opportunity follow-up, etc.).
   - This helps the sales team stay better organized, distinguishing between different types of appointments or tasks in the agenda.

4. **Colors for Teams or Employees**:
   - You can also assign colors to different employees or teams within the CRM. This allows each user to easily see and manage their appointments and distinguish tasks according to the assigned responsible person.
   - This is useful for managing shared agendas, enabling teams to see who is in charge of each task or opportunity.

## Step 4: Synchronizing and Tracking Opportunities from the Agenda

1. **Automatic Synchronization**:
   - Every generated opportunity, whether from a quote or lead, can be automatically synchronized with the agenda.
   - This ensures that any new opportunity is visible to the sales manager, with automatic reminders scheduled for follow-up.

2. **Tracking Opportunities**:
   - The agenda allows you to continuously track each opportunity, reminding you of the next event or action to take.
   - Additionally, you can view the activity history related to each opportunity, helping maintain a clear and updated record.

3. **Opportunity Timeline View**:
   - The agenda offers a timeline view, where you can see the status and events related to each opportunity or client. This makes time management easier and ensures that no important appointments or tasks are missed.

## Step 5: Advanced Agenda Configuration

1. **Set Reminders and Alerts**:
   - You can set automatic reminders that will be sent before important appointments or events. This ensures that the sales team never misses an opportunity for contact or follow-up.

2. **Personalize the Agenda**:
   - Users can personalize the agenda view by changing colors, states, and phases according to the company’s specific needs.
   - This can be done from the CRM configuration panel, allowing you to adjust the agenda to your team’s working methodology.

## Conclusion

The eV4 CRM agenda is a powerful tool for planning and tracking commercial tasks and opportunities. The use of colors enhances visual clarity, allowing you to quickly identify the state of each opportunity or ongoing task. By leveraging the synchronization, reminders, and personalization features of the agenda, sales teams can manage their activities more efficiently, ensuring that each opportunity is managed optimally from the first contact to the closing.
