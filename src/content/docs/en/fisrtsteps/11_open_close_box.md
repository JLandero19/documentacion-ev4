---

#### Module: Point of Sale (POS)

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the new cash register opening and closing workflow in the POS module of eV4 ERP. This process ensures detailed control of cash in the register and allows for the management of multiple daily shifts, requiring the initial cash amount to be recorded before enabling register operations. From the POS panel, you can verify if the register is open and perform all related operations.

## Procedure

### 1. Opening the Cash Register

Opening the cash register is a mandatory step before you can operate with the system. Follow these steps:

- **Access the POS:**
  - Go to the main menu of eV4 and select the POS module.
  - On the main POS screen, check if the register is closed. If it is, a message will appear indicating this in the interface.

- **Start the Opening:**
  - Click on the **Open Cash Register** button.
  - In the pop-up window, enter the initial cash amount to be placed in the register. For example, `200.00 EUR`.

- **Confirm the Opening:**
  - Press **Save** to complete the process.
  - Once the opening is done, the system will enable cash register management options such as entries, exits, and daily closing.

### 2. Managing Cash Register Operations

Once the register is open, you can perform the following operations:

- **Cash Inflows:**
  - Use this option to record additional income, such as cash received for other purposes.
  - Access the **Cash Inflow** option, enter the reason and amount, and confirm.

- **Cash Outflows:**
  - Use this to record outflows such as minor purchases or payments to suppliers.
  - Select **Cash Outflow**, enter the description and amount, and save the transaction.

### 3. Daily Cash Register Closing

The closing can be done multiple times a day to manage shifts. Ensure that all operations are recorded before closing:

- **Verify the Balance:**
  - Access the balance panel in the POS to review the entries and exits for the current shift.

- **Perform the Closing:**
  - Click on **Close Cash Register**.
  - The system will prompt you to confirm the total cash present. Enter the counted physical amount and save.

- **Closing Report:**
  - Upon confirmation, a detailed report will be generated with the transaction summary for the shift.

## Example

- **Opening:** You place `200 EUR` as the initial fund.
- **Operations:**
  - Inflow: `50 EUR` (adjustment for additional sales).
  - Outflow: `30 EUR` (purchase of supplies).
- **Closing:** A total of `220 EUR` in cash is counted, reflecting the expected balance correctly.

## Display in the POS Panel

From the POS panel, you can quickly check the status of the register. The system will indicate if it is open or closed with an informational banner at the top of the screen.

## Conclusion

This workflow improves the accuracy of cash register management by requiring the registration of an initial balance and allows for easy control of daily shifts for cashiers.
