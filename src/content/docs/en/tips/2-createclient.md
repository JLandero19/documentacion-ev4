# Customers  

To start selling, you need to have customers.  
**eV4ERP** comes with a default **TEMPORARY CUSTOMER** already configured.  

## Add Customers  

You can manually add customers from the section: **SALES â†’ CUSTOMERS**.

You can also **import/export** the customer list using Excel files with our **IMPORT MANAGER**.
