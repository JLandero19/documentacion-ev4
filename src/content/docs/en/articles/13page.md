## **Creating a Budget in the CRM**  

### **Access the CRM Module**  
1. From the **eV4** main menu, go to the **CRM** module.  
2. Select the **Leads** or **Opportunities** option, depending on whether you are working with a **new contact** or an existing one.  

### **Start a Budget**  
1. Within the **lead or opportunity** record, go to the **Budgets** tab.  
2. Click on **"New Budget"** to start creating the budget.  

### **Complete the Budget Information**  
- **Client:** Ensure that the lead or contact is correctly assigned as a client.  
- **Products or Services:** Add the products or services from the available catalog.  
- **Prices and Quantities:** Set the price and quantity for each product or service.  
- **Budget Date:** Specify the date the budget is generated.  
- **Comments:** Add relevant observations or special conditions.  

### **Automatic Opportunity Generation**

## **Tracking Budgets**  

Tracking budgets is crucial to maintain **visibility of the status** of each opportunity. **eV4CRM** makes this process easier by updating **stages** and managing **events**.  

### **Opportunity Stages**  
Each budget is linked to an opportunity that goes through various stages:  

- **New:** The budget has been created but has not yet been presented to the client.  
- **In Negotiation:** The budget has been sent to the client and details are being discussed.  
- **Closed - Won:** The budget has been accepted and the opportunity has turned into a sale.  
- **Closed - Lost:** The budget has been rejected or the opportunity did not materialize.  

### **Events and Next Actions**  
- Assign an **event** to the budget to remind of **timely follow-ups** (calls, meetings, budget revisions, etc.).  
- Set **automatic reminders** to avoid leaving any budget without follow-up.  

### **Probability and Opportunity Value**  
Update the **probability of success** field and the **estimated value** of the opportunity to help the team **prioritize opportunities** with a higher chance of closing.

## **Confirming or Cancelling Budgets**  

### **Confirm Budget**  
If the client **accepts** the budget, mark the budget as **"Confirmed"**.  
The opportunity stage will automatically change to **"Closed - Won"**.  
If the budget is linked to a vehicle, the system will automatically mark the vehicle as **sold** and update the **deactivation date in inventory**.  

### **Cancel Budget**  
If the client **does not accept** the budget, mark it as **"Cancelled"**.  
The opportunity stage will automatically change to **"Closed - Lost"**.  
The system can be configured to **hide cancelled opportunities**, keeping the panel clean and focused on **active opportunities**.  

---

## **Viewing and Managing Opportunities in the Calendar**  

### **View Opportunities in the Calendar**  
Configure the system so that **active opportunities** are reflected in the **CRM calendar**.  
This allows the sales team to see their **upcoming events and appointments** related to budgets.  

### **Visible States in the Calendar**  
You can configure different states to reflect in the **timeline** of the calendar.  
Example: For rental companies, states like **"In Progress"**, **"Reserved"**, or **"Cancelled"** can be shown, improving workflow control.  

---

## **Automatic Opportunity Setup from Budgets**  

### **Save Budget Data in the "Name" Field**  
Configure the CRM to automatically save the **budget name** in the **"Opportunity Name"** field.  
This makes it easier to identify opportunities when managing **multiple budgets per lead**.  

### **Use Shortened Item Name**  
For lengthy descriptions, configure the system to use the **shortened name** of the item instead of the full name in the **opportunity**.  
This makes opportunity management **clearer and more organized**.

## **Conclusion**  

The generation and tracking of budgets in the **eV4 CRM** module is a **simple yet powerful** process for **maximizing business opportunities**.  

By generating budgets and linking them to **opportunities**, you can manage the sales cycle **from the first contact to the closing**.  
Proper configuration and use of tools like the **calendar and opportunity stages** ensure an **efficient workflow** for the sales team.
