# Management Groups in eV4 ERP

The **Management Groups** in eV4 ERP allow you to classify and manage items according to their specific characteristics. This option is especially useful in verticals such as dealerships and rentals, where items require more complex configurations. Each management group organizes items based on their usage or availability, enabling more detailed control over daily operations.

This tutorial will guide you through the configuration of **Management Groups** in eV4 ERP and how they apply to verticals like dealerships and rentals, but **are not used for retail**.

## Step 1: Access the Catalog Module

### Go to the Catalog module:
1. From the main menu of the eV4 ERP system, select the **Catalog** option.
2. Here, you can manage the companyâ€™s items and vehicles.

### Access Management Groups Configuration:
1. Within the **Catalog** module, look for the **Management Groups** section.
2. This option allows you to create, modify, and delete groups that determine the characteristics of items.

## Step 2: Create or Modify Management Groups

### Create a New Management Group:
1. Click **New** to add a new management group.
2. Assign a **descriptive name** that clearly identifies the purpose of the group, such as: `Rental`, `Web Featured`, etc.
3. Be sure to define the group correctly based on the **vertical you're working in** (dealerships, rentals, etc.).

### Assign Features to the Management Group:
- At this stage, you can define the **specific features** that distinguish this management group.
- **Management Groups** help classify items so that their management and visibility within the system are easier and more controlled.

### Save the Management Group:

## Step 3: Apply Management Groups in Dealerships

For **dealerships**, the following **Management Groups** are used:

- **RENTAL**: Groups vehicles available for rental, helping manage their availability and rates.
- **WEB FEATURED**: Vehicles or items that will be featured on the company website.
- **WEB NEW ARRIVALS**: Vehicles or items that are new arrivals to be highlighted as new launches or additions.
- **USED**: Used or second-hand vehicles available for sale.
- **MOTORHOME**: Vehicles specifically classified as motorhomes.
- **OPTIONAL**: Optional items that can be added to main vehicles or products.
- **SPARE PARTS**: Replacement parts or components needed for repairs and maintenance.
- **NEW**: New vehicles or items, generally intended for direct sale.

## Step 4: Assign a Management Group to an Item or Vehicle

### Select an item or vehicle:
1. From the **Catalog**, select the item or vehicle you want to assign a **Management Group** to.

### Assign the Management Group:
1. Within the item record, look for the **Management Group** field.
2. Select the group that best fits the itemâ€™s characteristics.
   - If it's a new vehicle for direct sale, select **NEW**.
   - If it's a rental vehicle, select **RENTAL**.
3. This will allow the item or vehicle to be **managed and filtered** according to the rules and options available for that group.

### Save the changes:
- Once the **Management Group** is assigned, save the changes so that the item is properly classified.

## Step 5: Use of Management Groups in Vertical Markets like Rentals and Dealerships

**Management Groups** allow the creation of useful segmentations in verticals such as **dealerships** or **vehicle rental businesses**. Each group enables more efficient management based on the itemâ€™s characteristics, improving organization and control.

### Examples of usage:
- **Dealerships**: Management groups such as `USED`, `NEW`, or `SPARE PARTS` are essential for managing inventory and sales options.
- **Rentals**: The `RENTAL` group is used to manage the availability and reservations of rental vehicles.

## Final Considerations

The correct use of **Management Groups** ensures that items are classified and managed according to their characteristics, providing **greater visibility and control** within the eV4 ERP system.  

This functionality is essential in verticals like **dealerships and rentals**, but **is not used in retail environments**, as they do not require the same advanced segmentation.
