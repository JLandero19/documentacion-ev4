# **POS Management in eV4 ERP**  

The **POS (Point of Sale)** is the tool for managing **in-store sales** of the company, facilitating quick and easy interaction with customers.  

When accessing the POS, a list of all **invoices generated** is displayed, whether manually created from the sales section or directly from the POS. A filter is available to facilitate **searching**.

---

## **Initial POS View**  

The initial view of the **POS** section shows the **search fields** empty by default. When performing a search, the fields retain the entered values, making it easier to repeat searches. To **reset** the template and clear the data from the last search, simply click the **“Reset”** button.
