# Expenses

This section collects the expenses related to the company, such as water, electricity, etc.

In the initial screen (**see Image 14: Administration - Expenses - Expense List**) of this section, we find the list of invoices related to the expenses entered into the system, along with search filters and a button that allows adding a new expense (**Button "New"**).
