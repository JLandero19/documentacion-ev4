#### CLIENTS - Initial View

This is the initial view of the **“CLIENTS”** section. Initially, the search fields are blank. When a search is made, the fields will retain the values entered in them, in case it is necessary to repeat a search with these data.

If we want to reset the template to its initial state and clear the last search data, we can do so by clicking the **“Reset”** button.

Another important button is the **“CLIENT IMPORTED FROM PRESTASHOP”** button.

#### Button Positions

This button has two positions:

- **NO**: Shows all available clients, including clients registered in ev4ERP and those imported from Prestashop.
- **YES**: Shows only the clients imported from Prestashop.

To create a new client, enter all their personal details such as name, document number, locality, etc., as well as their bank account, preferred payment method, a maximum credit limit, and the type of client they are.
