#### CRM Module in eV4 ERP: Basic Configuration

The CRM module in eV4 ERP is a powerful tool for efficiently managing contacts, leads, and business opportunities. However, to make the most of its features, it is crucial to set it up properly from the start. In this post, we will guide you step by step through the basic configuration of the CRM to ensure your sales team can work optimally.

##### Step 1: Configuring Contact Creation

When a contact is created in the CRM, either manually or through a web form, it is important to configure the required fields and rules to ensure consistency in the process. The following fields must be filled in when creating a contact:

- **Contact Date**: The date the first contact with the client is made.
- **Contact Time**: The exact time of the initial contact.
- **Commercial Name**: The company or business name of the client.
- **Document**: Legal identification (NIF, CIF, etc.).
- **Social Name**: The legal name of the company.
- **Contact Person**: The name of the person with whom contact was made.
- **Phone**: The client's contact phone number.
- **Email**: The contact's email address.
- **Contact Source**: Indicates where the lead came from (web, call, event, etc.).
- **Address**: The physical address of the client.
- **Postal Code**: The postal code corresponding to the client's address.

This basic information ensures that each new contact is well-identified and ready for future management.

##### Step 2: Configuring Opportunities

It is essential to properly configure the generation of opportunities in the system to ensure proper tracking of the sales process. These configurations ensure that opportunities are created automatically and are displayed correctly in the CRM.

#### Automatic Opportunity Generation

Set up the system so that when a budget is created, an opportunity for follow-up is automatically generated. This allows the sales manager to manage the evolution of the budget within the CRM.

### Opportunity Phases

- **Accepted Opportunity Phase**: Indicates the phase of an opportunity when a budget has been accepted. This could be "Closed - Won".
- **Cancelled Opportunity Phase**: Defines the phase for opportunities that have been lost or cancelled, such as "Closed - Lost".
- **Hide Cancelled Opportunities**: Configure the system to automatically hide cancelled opportunities from the management panel, making it easier to see active opportunities.

#### Opportunities from Web Contact

- **Web Contact Opportunity Phase**: Define the phase in which opportunities from web contact forms are placed, such as "New".

#### Visibility in the Agenda

To control the follow-up flow, you can configure the system so that opportunities, once created, are visible in the CRM agenda. This allows the sales team to manage their schedules and upcoming events in an organized manner.

#### Rental Status Visible in Timeline

If you work with rental vehicles, you can configure the following statuses to be visible in the timeline:

- Cancelled
- In Progress
- Incident
- Pending
- Received
- Reserved

##### Step 3: Required Fields for Creating Opportunities

For each opportunity created, either manually or through a budget, it is necessary to ensure the following required fields are collected:

- **Contact**: The client associated with the opportunity.
- **Name**: A descriptive name for the opportunity.
- **Phase**: The current status of the opportunity (e.g., New, Negotiation, Closed - Won).
- **Next Event Date**: The date scheduled for the next contact or related action for the opportunity.
- **Probability**: The estimated percentage that the opportunity will close successfully.
- **Project**: The project to which the opportunity is linked, if applicable.
- **Source**: The origin of the lead or opportunity.
- **Notes**: Additional information relevant to the opportunity.

##### Step 4: Configuring Auto-Opportunities from Budgets

One of the most efficient features of the CRM in eV4 is the automatic generation of opportunities from budgets. This configuration allows the system to convert budgets into opportunities automatically, with the following parameters:

#### Opportunity Phase

When a budget is created, a predefined opportunity phase is automatically assigned. This allows continuous tracking from the generation of the budget to the closing of the sale.

#### Save Budget Data in the "Name" Field

Set up the system so that the opportunity name is automatically filled with the data from the generated budget. This makes it easier to quickly identify the opportunity in the system.

#### Use Shortened Article Name

Instead of using the full name of the item or vehicle, you can configure the CRM to use a shortened or key name, making it easier to visualize opportunities in the CRM interface.

#### Conclusion

Proper configuration of the eV4 CRM module allows you to manage leads and opportunities efficiently, automating much of the follow-up and budget generation process. Configuring the required fields and defining how opportunities are managed from creation to conversion into sales optimizes the sales team's work and ensures that no lead or budget is left without follow-up.
