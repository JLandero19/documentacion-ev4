This is the initial view of the “SUPPLIERS” section. By default, the search fields are empty. When a search is performed, the fields will retain the values entered, in case it is necessary to repeat a search with these data.

If we want to reset the template and clear the last search data, we can do so by clicking the “Reset” button.

Within the supplier details, in addition to the various fields to complete about the supplier, there are several tabs, such as the supplier contacts and any PDF files or related documents we wish to save.
