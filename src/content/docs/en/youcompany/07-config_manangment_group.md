#### Module: Vehicle Catalog

Management Groups in eV4 ERP allow classifying and managing items according to their specific characteristics. This option is especially useful in verticals like dealerships and rentals, where items require more complex configurations. Each management group organizes items according to their usage or availability, allowing for more detailed control over daily operations.

This tutorial will guide you through the configuration of Management Groups in the eV4 ERP and how they are applied in verticals like dealerships and rentals, but they are not used for retail.

#### Step 1: Access the Catalog Module

- **Go to the Catalog Module**:
    - From the main menu of the eV4 ERP system, select the Catalog option.
    - Here, you can manage the company’s items and vehicles.

- **Access Management Group Configuration**:
    - Within the Catalog module, look for the Management Groups section.
    - This option allows you to create, modify, and delete groups that will determine the characteristics of the items.

#### Step 2: Create or Modify Management Groups

- **Create a New Management Group**:
    - Click on **New** to add a new management group.
    - Assign a descriptive name that clearly identifies the purpose of the group, such as **Rental**, **Web Highlights**, etc.
    - Make sure to correctly define the group according to the needs of the vertical you are working in (dealerships, rentals, etc.).

- **Assign Characteristics to the Management Group**:
    - At this stage, you can define the specific characteristics that differentiate this management group.
    - Management Groups help classify items in a way that makes their management and visibility within the system easier and more controlled.

- **Save the Management Group**:
    - Once the details of the new management group are configured, click **Save**.

#### Step 3: Apply Management Groups in Dealerships

For dealerships, the following Management Groups are used:

- **RENTAL**: This group includes vehicles available for rental, helping manage their availability and rates.
- **WEB HIGHLIGHTS**: Vehicles or items that will be highlighted on the company’s website.
- **WEB NEWS**: Groups the most recent vehicles or items that are to be featured as new launches or additions.
- **USED**: Used or second-hand vehicles available for sale.
- **MOTORHOME**: Vehicles specifically classified as motorhomes.
- **OPTIONAL**: Items that are optional and can be added to main vehicles or products.
- **SPARE PARTS**: Spare parts or components needed for repairs and maintenance.
- **NEW**: New vehicles or items, generally intended for direct sale.

#### Step 4: Assign a Management Group to an Item or Vehicle

- **Select an item or vehicle**:
    - From the Catalog, select the item or vehicle you want to assign a management group to.

- **Assign the Management Group**:
    - In the item’s record, look for the **Management Group** field.
    - Select the group that best fits the characteristics of the item. For example, if it is a new vehicle for direct sale, select **NEW**; if it is a vehicle for rental, select **RENTAL**.
    - This will allow the item or vehicle to be managed and filtered according to the rules and options available for that group.

- **Save the changes**:
    - Once the management group is assigned, save the changes so that the item is correctly classified.

#### Step 5: Use of Management Groups in Vertical Markets like Rentals and Dealerships

Management Groups allow creating useful segmentations in verticals like dealerships or vehicle rental companies. Each group enables more efficient management based on the characteristics of the item, improving organization and control.

- **Dealerships**: Management groups like **USED**, **NEW**, or **SPARE PARTS** are essential for managing inventory and sales options.
- **Rentals**: The **RENTAL** group is used to manage the availability and reservations of rental vehicles.

#### Final Considerations

Proper use of Management Groups ensures that items are classified and managed according to their characteristics, providing greater visibility and control within the eV4 ERP. This functionality is essential in verticals like dealerships and rentals, but it is not used in retail environments, as these do not require the same advanced segmentation.
