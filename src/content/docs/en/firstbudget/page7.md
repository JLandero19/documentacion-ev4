## Vehicle and Optional Pack Creation Manual

### Steps:

#### Creating the New Vehicle:
1. Click the **"New"** button to create a new vehicle record.
2. Fill in the mandatory fields in the vehicle’s details, including:
   - Vehicle information
   - Owner details
3. **Assigning families:** It’s important to correctly associate the vehicle with the relevant families. See the section **"Configuring Families for Items in Dealer Mode"** for more information.

#### Prices:
- **Cost Price:** Enter the purchase price of the vehicle excluding taxes.
- **Base Price:** Specify the base price of the vehicle excluding taxes.

### Creating the Optional Pack:

#### Configuring the Pack:
1. Create a new item as if it were a normal product.
2. Assign the name **"Optional Pack"** or something similar that describes the content of the package.
3. Set the pack price to **zero (0.00€)**.

#### Adding Options to the Pack:
1. In the optional pack details, include all the optional elements that form part of the package.
2. Refer to the provided image for an example of how to add optional items.

#### Discounts:
(Optional) Apply a discount to the optional pack. You can choose from two methods:
- **Percentage Discount:** Set a discount percentage to be automatically applied to the pack price.
- **Fixed Amount:** Specify a fixed amount to be deducted from the pack price.

#### Sale Price:
Define the **final sale price** of the pack. This price may be the original price of the pack minus the discount applied (if applicable).

### Associating the Optional Pack with the Vehicle:
1. Open the details of the newly created vehicle.
2. Go to the **"Optional"** tab.
3. Select the optional pack you want to associate with the vehicle.

#### Prices:

**Price for which the pack will be sold:**
- **Option 1:** Set the price at which the optional pack will be sold to the customer. This price may be the same as the sale price of the pack or lower.
  - **Example:** If the pack’s sale price is 5,000€ and you want to offer it to the customer for 1,000€, enter **1,000€** in this field.
- **Option 2:** Leave this field blank. In this case, the system will automatically apply the discount configured in the pack details.
  - **Example:** If the pack has a sale price of 5,000€ and a 100% discount is applied in the pack details, the system will show a price of **0.00€** for the pack in the vehicle details.

### Additional Considerations:
- The system will display the **final pack price** in the vehicle’s quote, taking into account the sale price of the pack and any discounts applied.
- You can create different **optional packs** with varying price and discount configurations to offer customers a greater variety of options.

### Additional Resources:
- Refer to the section **"[Configuring Families for Items in Dealer Mode](#)"** for more information about assigning families to vehicles.
- Review the **[system documentation](#)** for detailed information on managing optional items and discounts.
