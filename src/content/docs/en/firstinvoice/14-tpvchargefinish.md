# Charge and Finish

Let's take a detailed look at the different functions of the **“Charge and Finish”** button.

When we have finished adding all the items to the invoice and want to proceed with the payment, we simply need to press the **“Charge and Finish”** button, and the following screen will appear.

3. We can apply a rounding discount if we don’t want to charge the cents to the customer. To do this, we enter the amount we want to discount in negative in the **“ROUNDING DISCOUNT”** field.

Once the operation has been saved, the ticket will appear on the screen, and we will have the option to print it if needed.

If we press the **“Print”** button, the browser's print window will open, where we can configure the print settings and initiate printing.

After printing, press the **cancel** button to close this window, and we will return to the **“NEW TPV”** section to continue invoicing.

## General View of the TPV Section

In the general view of the **“TPV”** section, by default, only the tickets/invoices generated on the current day appear. If we want to see those from previous days, we can do so using the filters.

The rest of the operation is similar to sales, both in terms of collecting the invoice, generating it, and printing or sending it by email. Even the view is the same.
