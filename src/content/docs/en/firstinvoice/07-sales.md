This is the initial view of the "INVOICES" section. By default, the search fields are left blank. When a search is performed, the fields will retain the values entered, in case it is necessary to repeat a search with the same data.

If we want to reset the initial state of the template and clear the last search's data, we can do so by clicking the "Reset" button.

To create a new sale, select the **WAREHOUSE**, the invoice series in the "**Invoice No.**" field, the **CUSTOMER** to whom the invoice is issued, and the **invoice issue date** in the "**Invoice Date**" field.

The "**DUE TYPE**" field allows us to select the type of due date: cash, or 30, 60, or 90 days.

To quickly add products to the invoice, we can enter the product's barcode using a barcode scanner, which will bring the product and its data. Additionally, by clicking on the "**LINE DETAIL**" button, we can enter more details about the product.

To print and send the invoice, the process is the same as the one followed in previous sections.

Clicking it will open a popup window with the delivery notes assigned to the selected customer. There, we can select the delivery notes we want to import and click "Accept." This will automatically import all the lines from the selected delivery notes into our invoice.

Another functionality in the "Options" dropdown menu is the option to apply a **discount**. When selecting this option, a popup will appear where we can enter a percentage to be discounted from the total price.

Finally, there is the option to access the calendar directly from the new invoice screen, enabling us to schedule an appointment with the customer.

Once the invoice is generated, the view will appear as shown in the following image, with the addition of a new button, "**Collect Invoice**."
