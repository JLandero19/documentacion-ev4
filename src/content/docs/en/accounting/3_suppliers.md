This is the initial view of the ***“SUPPLIERS”*** section, where the search fields are initially blank. When performing a search, the fields will retain the values entered by default, in case it’s necessary to repeat a search related to these data.

If we want to reset the template to its initial state and clear the data from the last search, we can do so by clicking the ***“Reset”*** button.

Within the supplier's content, in addition to the various fields to fill out about the supplier, we have a series of tabs such as the supplier's contacts, PDF files, or related documents we wish to store.
